# Uploading Images

There are two ways to attach images to items in the collection:
1. Upload files in CPanel and attach them via **Sideload** (preferred)
2. Upload files individually in *Edit Item* screen

The merits and instructions for these two methods are discussed below.

## Batch Upload Images with Sideload

**Sideload** is the preferred way to upload and attach images to items since it requires the files to be uploaded to the server before they are attached to an item in the Omeka S interface. 

To upload via Sideload, first log in to CPanel at [http://wilcox.ku.edu/cpanel](http://wilcox.ku.edu/cpanel) and navigate to the file explorer. In the file system access `public_html/sideload`.
