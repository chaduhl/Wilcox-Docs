# Managing Items

## Create a New Item

From the **Admin Dashboard**, navigate to **Items**. Click the **Add new item** button in the top right-hand corner. Select what type of item you would like to create from the **Resource Template** dropdown menu and begin filling in the fields with information about the item.

> **Note:**
> Be sure to follow naming and formatting conventions as supplied by the curator. As an example, we will create a new entry for a coin together. To begin, choose **Coin** from the **Resource Template** dropdown menu. This will automatically populate the screen with the necessary fields for entering information about a coin.

Then, click the dropdown menu for **Class** and select **Coin**. This will be at the bottom of the dropdown menu, listed under **Wilcox Collection Ontology**.

Now that we have the information fields we need, we can begin entering information for our item. If you do not have certain information for a given field, you can delete the field by clicking the @icon-trash trash can icon to the right of the text box. In this case, we are creating a new item for the collection that does not have an **Old Inventory Number**, so we should delete that field.

Note: For many items, the **Old Inventory Number** field is hidden from public view and will thus have @icon-eye-slash the slashed eye icon below the @icon-trash trash can icon. To hide a specific field simply click the @icon-eye normal eye icon to toggle that field’s visibility.

Each information field has a name, a description to explain what exactly should go into that field, and an identifier formatted as `wcx:[identifier]`. The identifier corresponds to the XML metadata schema developed for the collection. Do not worry about this, since it only pertains to the accessibility of the collection to other linked-open data projects.

Let’s assume we know the exact date for this coin to be 100 BCE. To indicate this in the data, type -100 into the date field. For Wilcox metadata schema, a negative number indicates BCE while a positive number indicates CE.

If the exact date is unknown, enter a date range for the object in the correct fields.

> **Note:**
> For more information on the formatting for individual fields, see the section entitled [**Wilcox Collection Ontology**](wcx_ontology.md).

For some information fields, you must choose another Omeka item as the field input. A good example of this is the **Material** field. To enter a coin’s material, find the **Material** information field and click the button entitled @icon-cubes **Omeka resource**.

Click @icon-cube **Items** and select the relevant item from the menu on the right hand side:

In this case, we will filter our search to the **Material Item Set** by clicking “Filter Search” and then selecting **Material** from the “Filter by item set” dropdown menu. This will retrieve all the materials entered into the database.

Simply select **Silver** and then delete the blank text field from the **Material** information field.

Finish entering the information for your item. Like **Material**, the following fields require you to choose an **Omeka resource** instead of entering a text value:

- Material
- Denomination
- Coin Wear
- Issuers

Once you have entered all the information for the new item, navigate to the Media tab at the top of the page.

If images for the item have already been loaded onto the server via **Sideload**, select the **Sideload** option for as many images as there are for the new item. If you are uploading the images yourself, simply click **Upload**.

Every time you click one of the “Add Media” options on the right side of the screen, a new upload field will be added to the page. Each upload field corresponds to only one image. You may add as many upload fields as needed. It is not necessary to enter a title for the uploaded image.

After uploading your images or choosing them via **Sideload**, navigate to the **Item Sets** tab.
Choose the relevant item set for the new item from the right hand side of the page. **Item Sets** are sorted by which user created them. For this example, we will select **Numismatic Collection**. 

Finally, all items are automatically marked as **Hidden** when first created. This indicated by the @icon-trash trash can icon at the top right of the page. To mark the item as visible, simply click the icon to toggle its visibility status.

Click the **Add** button at the top right of the page to finish creating a new item.

## Edit an Item

To edit a specific item, find the item you want to edit via the search bar, items, or item sets. If you are logged in as an admin, you can also edit the item directly from its item page on the site. Once you’ve located the item, click “Edit.”

This will bring you to the same type of page as when you create a new item, except most (if not all) of the information fields should be filled with information.

From here, you can edit the information that needs to be amended, change the media associated with the item, change the item’s item set, etc. Be sure to click the save button in the top right after you’re finished.
