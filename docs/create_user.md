# Create a New User

Any user designated as an admin on the site can create a new user. To do so, simply access the **Admin Dashboard** by logging in at [wilcox.ku.edu/admin](http://wilcox.ku.edu/admin). You should see the screen below:

There will likely be a notification that there is an available update to Omeka S. Ignore this, since it is the decision of the curator and KU IT whether to install any updates.
Click on the **Users** tab under the **Admin** subheading in the menu on the left.
