# Managing Pages

## Create a Page

From the **Admin Dashboard** click **Sites** at the top of the left-hand menu and then select “The Wilcox Classical Museum.” Omeka S is capable of hosting multiple sites on the same server, but the Wilcox Collection only requires the single “site” for its purposes. This will open up an additional set of menu options in the left-hand menu.

Click **Pages**.

This opens a menu of all the current pages on the site. Clicking on a page title will open that page for editing. See **Edit a Page** for more information on editing pages. 

Click **Add a New Page** at the top right of the page. Give the page a **Title**, which will be displayed as the default title when accessing the page from the public view. Then give the page a **Slug**. This is the text that will be appended to the end of the base URL for the site. Finally check **Add to Navigation**.

In the case of the screenshot above, the new page will be titled “Test Page” and will be accessible at http://wilcox.ku.edu/s/wilcox/page/test-page. Click **Add** in the top right corner of the page and you will be directed to the editing screen for your newly created page.

This is where the content for the page lives. You can see that from here you can change the previously selected **Title** and **Slug**. It is also already given a **Page Title** field.

Omeka S pages are set up in a block format. Instead of coding each page individually from scratch, there are specific templates that you can add to a page. The most essential of these is the **HTML** block, which is used for basic text among other things. To add an **HTML** block, simply click the **HTML** button in the **Add New Block** menu on the right-hand side of the screen.

You can begin inputting your desire text. As you can see in the screenshot above, you can also style your text with the rich text formatter. Other useful blocks include:

- **Media**, used to add an image or video to a page
- **Item Showcase**, used display multiple selected objects from the collection
- **Item with metadata**, used to display a single item

Just as in all the editing screens, you can add and delete blocks at will. If you wish to delete a previously added block, click the @icon-trash trash can icon.

You can preview the page before making it live by clicking the **View** button in the top right of the screen. To save the page, click the **Save** button in the top right. By clicking the save button, you are publishing your edits to the live version of the site.

Once you’ve created and saved the new page. Click **Navigation** in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen. This will bring you to an overview of how the site navigation is laid out.

The test page we just created was added to the bottom of the navigation hierarchy. You can click and drag the page and place it wherever you desire within the hierarchy. Notice that page links can be nested inside others. For example, there are several pages nested under **About Us** which creates a dropdown menu on the public site. 

Once you’ve placed the new page in its final location, click the **Save** button.
